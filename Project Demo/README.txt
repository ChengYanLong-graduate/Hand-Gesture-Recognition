This is a short demo of our course project.
In our project, we trained our own CNN model to classify static
hand gestures. There are 10 different gestures in the dataset.

In the demo, we randomly select 20 images from the testing set, we 
display those images together with their correct labels and our model's
predicted labels. As you can see, all of the test images are correctly
labeled by our CNN model. In general, the test accuracy for 500 test
images is 94.60%.
